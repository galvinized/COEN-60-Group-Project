  <p style="margin: 50px; font-size: 25px;">Navigating Benson is a guide for all SCU students. This guide is a necessity for <b>YOU</b> to navigate through your college experience. This website gives students access to a calorie counter to keep track of what you are eating. This allows you to be on track with how much you eat, what you eat, and how healthy you are being. Without this guide, we assure you that it will be difficult to have a healthy quarter. Now enjoy and eat at Benson!</p>

  <ul style="margin: 50px; font-size: 25px;">
    <li>Remember to order your meals in advance to avoid the long waits.
</li>
    <li>While Globe meals are always good and a fresh choice on the app, watch out for the over 20$ price tag on just one meal. You will run out of points quickly if you get this often in the week. Choose one night a week to be a Globe meal and change it up once and a while.
</li>
    <li>Use the cellar to your advantage for in-dorm dining. You can make yourself some ramen, pizza, pasta, a good PB&J, and many other options right from your dorm.
</li>
    <li>If you’re low on cash, choose low cost meals with a lot of food in return. La Parrilla burrito bowls offer a lot of food and flavor, 540 pizza slices are huge for roughly $5 each. 
</li>
    <li>Take advantage of late night benson. Fire and 540 are open till at least 12:30 AM 6 days a week. They even offer Chicken Tenders during late night benson. (The chicken tenders are rumored to give you crazy dreams the night you eat them) 
</li>
<li>There are some great special nights to keep an eye out for. On Tuesdays and Firdays, Mission Bakery has dessert specials like ice cream and churros. Some of these aren’t orderable on the app so you might have to order at the kiosk.
</li>
