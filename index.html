      <p class="center-text">Navigating Benson is a guide for all SCU students. This guide is a necessity for <b>YOU</b> to navigate through your college experience. This website gives students access to a calorie counter to keep track of what you are eating. This allows you to be on track with how much you eat, what you eat, and how healthy you are being. Without this guide, we assure you that it will be difficult to have a healthy quarter. Now enjoy and eat at Benson!</p>

  <h1 class="center-text">Tips and Tricks</h1>

  <ul id="trips-text">
    <li>Remember to order your meals in advance to avoid the long waits.
</li>
    <li>While Globe meals are always good and a fresh choice on the app, watch out for the over 20$ price tag on just one meal. You will run out of points quickly if you get this often in the week. Choose one night a week to be a Globe meal and change it up once and a while.
</li>
    <li>Use the cellar to your advantage for in-dorm dining. You can make yourself some ramen, pizza, pasta, a good PB&J, and many other options right from your dorm.
</li>
    <li>If you’re low on cash, choose low cost meals with a lot of food in return. La Parrilla burrito bowls offer a lot of food and flavor, 540 pizza slices are huge for roughly $5 each.
</li>
    <li>Take advantage of late night benson. Fire and 540 are open till at least 12:30 AM 6 days a week. They even offer Chicken Tenders during late night benson. (The chicken tenders are rumored to give you crazy dreams the night you eat them)
</li>
<li>There are some great special nights to keep an eye out for. On Tuesdays and Firdays, Mission Bakery has dessert specials like ice cream and churros. Some of these aren’t orderable on the app so you might have to order at the kiosk.
</li>

      <p>Hello, I am Pierce. I am a sophmore computer science major from Vancouver at Santa Clara University. After burning through 75% of his dining expenses with the first third of the quarter he quickly realised that no amount of intuition can save your budget from Bensons escalating prices.</p>

      <p>Hello, I am Danny Walsh. I am a sophomore web design and engineering student from Massachusetts. I am on the SCU club Men’s Ice Hockey team and an underclass representative for BroncoSec. I have a lot of experience in today’s Benson mobile ordering environment, and I found how to stretch the limited Benson points we are given. My favorite place to eat at Benson is Fire.</p>

      <p>Hi, I'm Farhaan Pishori and I'm a freshman at Santa Clara University. I plan to major in Computer Science, a career that is based in problem solving, an essential skill for life. My experience at Benson has been quite interesting. It has its ups and downs but I still love it. It's like an annoying younger sibling. Irritating yet still lovable. I believe that Navigating Benson will significantly improve the Santa Clara Experience. Enjoy!</p>

      <p>Hello, my name is Andy and I’m currently a first year Web Design & Engineering major at Santa Clara University. I’m not alone when I say the Benson Memorial Cafe has room for improvement, as every Bronco can testify to the lack of proper nutrition guidance found on the campus’ largest dining center. It is my unwavering belief that all young people, college students or not, are entitled to accurate caloric information.</p>
